1- Weather Information:
    When we ask google to give us the weather update and google gives us specific weather 
    like degrees, precipitation or what it feels like. So this data is coming from 
    a third-party application through API so this way API helps ton transfer the data

2- Account Login:
    This is another example of API like when we go into a socialmedia site API checks whether this person
    is already logged in or not so it checks and gives us the login page so the user can login again

3- Pay with Account:
    In this example we can see that when the user purchases something if he clicks on the Google Pay option
    the API is gonna tell that how much amount is owed and other details so if everything goes according
    to plan the API send the payment done option back to the user

4- Application Bots:
    Sometimes we see that there are bots which gives us information those are API too. We can say that
    in netflix or other apps we get some certain news that is basically API because it is automated to give
    certain information to user that this is what you should see or this is a suggestion for you

5- Flight Booking:
    In this we go to a agency to book a ticket they give us a certain airline ticket as we requested this
    is all because of API. The agency has some access to the airlines because of API so this API lets the
    agency to look through the flight and seat no. and gives us a vacant seat if available, just like this
    we get a ticket

6- Dictionary:
    This platform is an example of API like from this we can see that if we make a request for a word we 
    get the definition of the particular word and apart from that we get synonyms so this API gives us a
    lot information about the word we searched and also gives us the sentence for that word for our example

7- Movie Tickets:
    When we go for a movie what we can do is book a ticket this is also done by API like if we search for
    a theatre we can go for a site it can show that this is the closest to your location and then from that
    we can book a vacant seat of our choice so this is how it works

8- Online Gaming:
    This is also a good example of API, when we open the game it lets us join with the server and from 
    that we are able to play with our friends this is the work of API because we are joined as a client and
    then we request to join to the server so the API helps us complete our request and lets us join the server

9- Soundcloud:
    This is also an example of API because in this site we are able to listen other people music this is
    because of API it completes our request listening to our call that what music we want what type we
    want and then it gives the artist and music which let's us listen to our desired song

10- NASA:
    Apparently the best news about the space and stuff we can get from NASA in this a user can call the API
    and then the it's gonna get the data from the databse and gonna tell the user that these are the stats
    or these are the earth images or this is the news about mars or what is the asteroids stats and from this
    we can get the data needed with the help of API
